How do you handle my body?
You touch me, see me, smell me
are me
my blood on your hands.                          
And, whan this creatur was thus 
gracyowsly comen ageyn to hir mende, 
sche thowt sche was bowndyn to 
THE BODY and that sche wold ben his 
servawnt.

Margery Kempe dedicated her being 
to God. 
She wanted to be a saint. She felt the 
presence of the Lord in her body and with 
mouth, fingers, legs, breast, tongue, 
embodied him and was holy. 
Who is Margery Kempe?

I’m afraid of her.                          
There’s no way to talk about the creature 
without talking about Daddy. During the 
months of therapy that followed my broken 
fist and brokenness, my therapist asked 
me to consider:

“What it is about you that made you think 
this was okay?”
