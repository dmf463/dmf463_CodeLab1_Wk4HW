How do you handle my body?
You touch me, see me, smell me
are me
my blood on your hands.

Her friend called me without knowing that 
the monster and I had started sleeping 
together. It was a coincidence. “She’s in 
the back seat covered in puke. We only 
realized what was happening when we 
heard her gagging.” She had fallen asleep 
on her back and was choking. I went to 
her house. I picked her up out of the back 
seat. The smell of vomit and the slime of
bile on my skin made me gag. I carried 
her to the house and dropped her on top 
of her sheets. I put music on her iPod so 
she wouldn’t wake up to silence. The next
morning she called me to come over, I 
brought her Gatorade and crackers. She 
didn’t know how I knew. I told her I’d put 
her to bed. She cried.                          
"Ya, dowtyr, the mor wondryng that thow 
hast for my lofe, the mor thu plesyst me."
Than this creatur durst non otherwyse do
