“That felt really odd writing that, I feel like 
I held myself back because I’m scared of 
the implications of writing anything down. 
Writing it down makes it real. Not really, it 
is real. But if someone were to read this, 
it’d be like bearing (baring?) my soul for 
the world to see. But isn’t that what poetry 
is? Baring your soul to the world? How does
she do it? How does she make everything 
so available, yet at the same time close 
everyone off? It’s bad that I’m starting to 
really feel something for her. Bad because 
of the moral ambiguity from that poem. 
I’m with her and everything really is gray; 
there no longer exists black and white. But 
maybe I’ve always believed in ambiguity 
and non-absolutes and she actually lives 
that life while I sit in my safe little world 
peering in through the pages of a book. 
Philosophers and texts offer a window, but 
she offers a doorway. I can say I’m glad 
that I feel it’s bad to know her because 
what IS bad? What society has instilled in 
me? What I fear my peers will think, or 
how they’ll react? No, I like this bad. It 
feels so transgressive. My time with her 
is fun, and while it should be exhausting, it 
never is. It’s the reason that whether we 
stay friends or develop into something 
more, I’ll never forget her and I’ll never 
regret her. She’s shown me that I can live without fear.”

And I cried and scratched and became 
a witness thereof
Hiding in the bathroom
Tearing my hair
My body a prison
My body her canvas
My body her toy
Her love
Her sex

My body was her medication.
David, the science shows that sex helps depression.

Her body next to me kills me
I want to push
(shove,
asserting the space between our bodies)
her away,
I want to be in an ocean
Among the coral and the kemp
Dead and living.
I want to be Margery Kempe
And cry myself to salvation.
I tell her no.
She screams at me.
It’s my fault.
It’s not my fault.
It’s my fault.
Oh my god it’s my fault.
I don’t want to.
But I do it anyways.
And I lie still as she has her way with me.
And at some point I start hate-fucking her.
And I realize I’m hate-fucking myself,
And I want to hurt her,
And I hate myself,
And I fuck her harder,
And it feels good,
And I hate myself
And she moans, body shakes,
And my skin doesn’t feel like my skin,
I’m an imposter, she’s the victim.
She kisses me and I want
My body
To erase the scars her lips leave behind.
