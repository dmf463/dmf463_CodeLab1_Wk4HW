It’s hard to be honest when you don’t 
know what truth is. For so long I’ve 
characterized her as a monster, a terrorist, 
a sociopath, a psychopath, and I know 
she’s toxic, I know she washes over 
everything with coat of negativity and 
manipulation and she’s sidetracked lives 
and stolen opportunities, but I gave 
up trying to say anything, I didn’t tell her,
there was no communication, no 
towardness, only pure empty space. 
I tried to tell her in the beginning but it 
always ended with me being wrong and 
hating myself for it. I learned not to 
question her. I learned not to speak up. 
I learned that my words opened the doors 
to my destruction. So I was silent.
But I did give up. I stopped trying to tell 
her that she was hurting me. I stopped 
disagreeing with her. Derrida says that the 
yes opens the path to being, but all I said 
was yes and the foundations of my 
sensibilities were rendered inert. My body 
couldn’t communicate, neural pathways 
were blocked and sealed.

I tell the police officers
he could charm the white off rice.
He’s a good person,
he just hates everyone
except his family.
I’m playing with a toy.
Dad moves the wheel
violently from side to side,
“Dracula is on the car!”
My high pitched squeal can’t be placed
as delight or fright.
The cheese on the eggplant parmesan
is reminiscent of lasagna,
baked ziti.
Dad, the master chef
without a restaurant.
Miserable that instead of serving to provide,
he’s serving to serve.
“Get down on your knees,
And say ‘I’m a little bitch’”
He swings a gun.
My father,
Clint Eastwood.
A mirror of an illusion he wants to be
because the pistol whip hurts his wrist.
“I have no one” he says
“fuck off” he says
“I hate my job” he says
“the premium costs $75” he says.
He says
and does nothing but create the world he hates so much.
“I don’t want to be a burden”
“I can call you whenever, right?”
These assholes all fuck me over.
I’m the only good one.

My body was her medication.
David, the science shows that sex helps depression.

Her body next to me kills me
I want to push
(shove,
asserting the space between our bodies)
her away,
I want to be in an ocean
Among the coral and the kemp
Dead and living.
I want to be Margery Kempe
And cry myself to salvation.
I tell her no.
She screams at me.
It’s my fault.
It’s not my fault.
It’s my fault.
Oh my god it’s my fault.
I don’t want to.
But I do it anyways.
And I lie still as she has her way with me.
And at some point I start hate-fucking her.
And I realize I’m hate-fucking myself,
And I want to hurt her,
And I hate myself,
And I fuck her harder,
And it feels good,
And I hate myself
And she moans, body shakes,
And my skin doesn’t feel like my skin,
I’m an imposter, she’s the victim.
She kisses me and I want
My body
To erase the scars her lips leave behind.
