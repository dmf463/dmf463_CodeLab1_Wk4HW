“He is not transfigured at all…But in 
remaining man—at his limit (is man 
anything but a limit?)—he does not bring 
forth his human essence. On the contrary, 
he lets appear an extremity upon which 
no human essence can take place. This is 
the limit that man is: his exposure—to his 
death, to others, to his being- in-common.
Which is to say, always, in the end, to his 
singularity: his singular exposure to his
singularity."

-     Jean-Luc Nancy, “Literary Communism”
