There was no me.
I embodied her.
I became her.
Her fault was my fault.
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay
It’s okay It’s okay It’s okay

She folds her clothes with such precision…
She trails off laughing at me to herself
(still folding clothes)
But back to what I came here to do.
Revision.
Rework.
Create and question the question of creation.
“Take off your shoes”
She says,
“The floor musn’t get dirty.”
With a single bed staring at a microwave
Her entertainment
her refrigerator that is
stove, sink, towel rack,
Half stained dishes hardening with hummus.
She makes a shelf
With condiments, crackers, and pop tarts
While homeless
Books of poetry
(Ginsberg and Bukowski)
Lie next to Lo-Li-Ta
Trippingly on the tongue
Like the taste of drugs in a syringe.
The floor must not get dirty
As she picks up individual strands of hair
From the tile of her efficiency
Falling
As she strokes and pulls
At its comforting blackness
The floor must not get dirty
As I sit on the bed
And watch
As lines of heroin
Lines of poetry
Numb her to the atrocities of her life—
Body—
But I smile because I know my support—
My body—
And driving her at midnight to get a new journal
And playing drunken Scrabble—
B3/O1/D2/Y4—
Is what I can give in payment for her
Freckles and her smile.
And I know that supporting her
Being there and letting
(enabling)
Her destroy herself—
Her body—
Is more than I can do.
The floor must not get dirty,
As she puts down the phone
Stop breathing
You’ll hyperventilate
Pass out
Hit the floor
So she stops.
Knowing that she needs to make sure
That the floor must not get dirty.

“when narrative identity is unbearable, 
when the boundary between subject and 
object is shaken, and when even the limit 
between inside and outside becomes 
uncertain, the narrative is what is 
challenged first. If it continues nevertheless, 
its makeup changes; its linearity is shattered, 
it proceeds by flashes, enigmas, short cuts, 
incompletion, tangles and cuts. At a later 
stage, the unbearable identity of the narrator 
and of the surroundings that are supposed 
to sustain whim can no longer be narrated 
but cries out or is descried with maximal 
stylistic intensity (language of violence, of 
obscenity, or of a rhetoric that relates the 
text to poetry). The narrative yields to a 
crying-out theme that when it tends to 
coincide with the incandescent states of 
boundary-subjectivity…called abjection, is 
the crying-out theme of suffereing-horror. 
In other words, the theme of 
suffering-horror is the ultimate evidence 
of such states of abjection within a 
narrative representation. If one wished to 
proceed further still along the approaches 
to abjection, one would find neither 
narrative nor theme but a recasting of 
syntax and vocabulary—the violence of 
apoetry, and silence.”
-Julia Kristeva, The Powers of Horror
