There was no me.
I embodied her.
I became her.
Her fault was my fault.

I’M SO FUCKING TIRED
She doesn’t let me sleep.
It’s psychological warfare.
My eyes grow heavy,
And I start to drift,
But I can’t trust falling asleep
Because it’s an injustice against her.
I’m leaving her alone.
She screams, cries:
How could you do this to me?
I only want to sleep.
Sleep is the comfort, my eyelids the barrier,
Curtains closing,
But the play never ends.
Sleep is the enemy of love.

My body was her medication.
David, the science shows that sex helps depression.
http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/sexual-health
Her body next to me kills me
I want to push
(shove,
asserting the space between our bodies)
her away,
I want to be in an ocean
Among the coral and the kemp
Dead and living.
I want to be Margery Kempe
And cry myself to salvation.
I tell her no.
She screams at me.
It’s my fault.
It’s not my fault.
It’s my fault.
Oh my god it’s my fault.
I don’t want to.
But I do it anyways.
And I lie still as she has her way with me.
And at some point I start hate-fucking her.
And I realize I’m hate-fucking myself,
And I want to hurt her,
And I hate myself,
And I fuck her harder,
And it feels good,
And I hate myself
And she moans, body shakes,
And my skin doesn’t feel like my skin,
I’m an imposter, she’s the victim.
She kisses me and I want
My body
To erase the scars her lips leave behind.

Her friend called me without knowing that 
the monster and I had started sleeping 
together. It was a coincidence. “She’s in 
the back seat covered in puke. We only 
realized what was happening when we 
heard her gagging.” She had fallen asleep 
on her back and was choking. I went to 
her house. I picked her up out of the back 
seat. The smell of vomit and the slime of
bile on my skin made me gag. I carried 
her to the house and dropped her on top 
of her sheets. I put music on her iPod so 
she wouldn’t wake up to silence. The next
morning she called me to come over, I 
brought her Gatorade and crackers. She 
didn’t know how I knew. I told her I’d put 
her to bed. She cried.

I tell the police officers
he could charm the white off rice.
He’s a good person,
he just hates everyone
except his family.
I’m playing with a toy.
Dad moves the wheel
violently from side to side,
“Dracula is on the car!”
My high pitched squeal can’t be placed
as delight or fright.
The cheese on the eggplant parmesan
is reminiscent of lasagna,
baked ziti.
Dad, the master chef
without a restaurant.
Miserable that instead of serving to provide,
he’s serving to serve.
“Get down on your knees,
And say ‘I’m a little bitch’”
He swings a gun.
My father,
Clint Eastwood.
A mirror of an illusion he wants to be
because the pistol whip hurts his wrist.
“I have no one” he says
“fuck off” he says
“I hate my job” he says
“the premium costs $75” he says.
He says
and does nothing but create the world he hates so much.
“I don’t want to be a burden”
“I can call you whenever, right?”
These assholes all fuck me over.
I’m the only good one.

And I suffered her, and I loved her. The 
first time she came to my house was 
because she was scared of being alone in 
her efficiency. Suicide was an option for 
her. The mutilation of her body a reality. 
She found solace in poetry, she was 
poetry. She wrote on her body, and in 
writing her body wrote her death, 
because one completed the other. 
She knew this and it scared her. She 
asked if she could spend the night. My 
mother told me 
“Don’t sleep with her.”


“He is not transfigured at all…But in 
remaining man—at his limit (is man 
anything but a limit?)—he does not bring 
forth his human essence. On the contrary, 
he lets appear an extremity upon which 
no human essence can take place. This is 
the limit that man is: his exposure—to his 
death, to others, to his being- in-common.
Which is to say, always, in the end, to his 
singularity: his singular exposure to his
singularity."

He was in love, though. That’s what he said.
And it makes sense now how when 
everyone in my family warned me about 
the creature, my dad thought she was 
amazing. He was as broken as she was.

The difference between me and my father 
was that at some point he realized he 
wasn’t helping Chloe and he told her 
‘you need to go back to Colorado, be with 
your family, I can’t help you.’ So he 
bought her a plane ticket and sent her 
home. He felt good about what he’d done, 
but also felt the constant ache of having 
left the person you love and the 
acknowledgement that you couldn’t do 
anything for them.

Love doesn’t fix everything.
