How do you handle my body?
You touch me, see me, smell me
are me
my blood on your hands.

“That felt really odd writing that, I feel like 
I held myself back because I’m scared of 
the implications of writing anything down. 
Writing it down makes it real. Not really, it 
is real. But if someone were to read this, 
it’d be like bearing (baring?) my soul for 
the world to see. But isn’t that what poetry 
is? Baring your soul to the world? How does
she do it? How does she make everything 
so available, yet at the same time close 
everyone off? It’s bad that I’m starting to 
really feel something for her. Bad because 
of the moral ambiguity from that poem. 
I’m with her and everything really is gray; 
there no longer exists black and white. But 
maybe I’ve always believed in ambiguity 
and non-absolutes and she actually lives 
that life while I sit in my safe little world 
peering in through the pages of a book. 
Philosophers and texts offer a window, but 
she offers a doorway. I can say I’m glad 
that I feel it’s bad to know her because 
what IS bad? What society has instilled in 
me? What I fear my peers will think, or 
how they’ll react? No, I like this bad. It 
feels so transgressive. My time with her 
is fun, and while it should be exhausting, it 
never is. It’s the reason that whether we 
stay friends or develop into something 
more, I’ll never forget her and I’ll never 
regret her. She’s shown me that I can live without fear.”

There was a reason I fell in love with her.

There’s no way to talk about the creature 
without talking about Daddy. During the 
months of therapy that followed my broken 
fist and brokenness, my therapist asked 
me to consider:

“What it is about you that made you think 
this was okay?”

And than sche sent for hyr gostly fadyr, 
for sche had a thyng in conscyens whech 
sche had nevyr schewyd beforn that tyme 
in alle hyr lyfe.
